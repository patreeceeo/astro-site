    Engineering helps us get where we're going, but where is that? Is it really as nice as they say? The way things have been going lately, I have my doubts.

    Hello, I am reckoning with a fractured identity. In one fragment, I am an engineer. I enjoy building theories about how systems are used to achieve a fixed goal, or could be made to do it better. In another fragment, I'm a philosopher who can't help but question that fixed goal. In yet another fragment, I'm an artist who thinks both the engineer and the philosopher need to touch grass. Ultimately, I am all and none of these. These fractures have been inflicted by the prevailing worldview, which, in this blog, I attempt to transcend.
